# Merge-LLMs
This repo contains a new tool that can merge multiple LLMs by using **mergekit**


"mergekit" is a toolkit for merging pretrained large language models. It enables complex merges in environments with limited resources, supporting different algorithms and can operate on CPU or minimal GPU. Key features include lazy tensor loading, interpolated gradients, and the ability to combine models from various layers. It supports Linear, SLERP, Task Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE merging methods, with tokenizer source specifications. This toolkit simplifies creating more versatile and powerful language models by effectively combining different pretrained models' strengths. For detailed information and usage instructions, please refer to the GitHub repository.
